all of the provisions of these Terms of Use.  As used herein, Imation Products, Software and Services will refer only
to those Imation Products, Software and Services purchased for or by the End-User and the End-User rights herein
shall only extend to those Imation Products, Software and Services for which full payment has been made.

Software or Services, you hereby represent and warrant that you are the duly authorized agent of such Customer
and that such Customer (i) has received a copy of these Terms of Use; (ii) has duly and properly approved the
purchase and use of the Imation Products, Software and Services on such Customer's behalf and has authorized
you to enter into these binding Terms of Use by and on behalf of such Customer; and (iii) has agreed to pay all

agents, partners, service providers, affiliates and licensors (collectively, "Indemnitees") harmless from any liabilities,
claims, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) which arise from a breach of this
representation by you or as a result of any action or omission by you. For purposes of these Terms of Use, the word

connection with your use of the Imation Products, Software and/or Services.  You shall not, nor shall permit any

Services.

1.4  Protection of Security Data. Personal information, usernames, passwords and prompts (collectively "Security
Data") exchanged through the Imation Products, Services or Software are protected by advanced encryption
techniques. However, these security measures still require your responsible behavior in protecting your Security
Data. YOU SHALL ASSUME THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL TIMES FOR THE SUPERVISION,
MANAGEMENT, CONTROL AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR SECURITY DATA AND ASSUME THE ENTIRE
RISK FOR THE FRAUDULENT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR SECURITY DATA. YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT FAILURE TO PROTECT YOUR SECURITY DATA MAY ALLOW AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSON OR
ENTITY TO ACCESS YOUR IMATION PRODUCT, SOFTWARE AND/OR SERVICE.

occurred, it is your responsibility to immediately notify each and every person and entity that is affected by such

sent to you via email. Only upon submission of such confirmation of your activation will your Imation Product be

Terms of Use immediately: (i) if you have breached these Terms of Use, (ii) if you have failed to make payments for
the Imation Products, Software or Services or (iii) if Imation in its sole discretion believes it is required to do so by
law.  At Imation’s sole discretion, Imation may terminate or suspend any feature or service contained in the Imation
Product, Software or Service. If Imation terminates or suspends any feature or service, for reasons other than those
listed in the prior sentence or in Section 2.2 (Section 2.2 is applicable to enterprise users only), Imation will either
reimburse a pro-rata share of the fees paid, as determined by Imation in its sole discretion, for such feature or
service, or substitute such feature or service with a substantially similar feature or service.

SECTIONS 2.2 AND 2.3 ARE APPLICABLE TO ENTERPRISE USERS ONLY

2.2 Automatic Renewal; Termination of Services. Services provided in connection with the Imation Product shall
automatically renew for successive one-year terms at Imation’s then current pricing unless you provide written
notice to Imation at least thirty days prior to the end of the current term of Service and close your account for the
Imation Service.  Your notice should be sent via email to securitycs@Imation.com, or in writing to Imation's address
at: 910 East Hamilton Ave, Suite 410, Campbell CA 95008.

At Imation's sole option, Imation may suspend or terminate the Imation Service immediately: (i) if Imation suspects
that someone other than you knows, is using or attempting to use your Security Data (although Imation has no
obligation to investigate whether any such unauthorized use is occurring), (ii) if you have breached these Terms of
Use, (iii) if you have failed to make payments for the Imation Services, or (iv) if Imation in its sole discretion believes
it is required to do so by law.

2.3 Reinstatement of Lapsed Services. If your Imation Service is suspended, your account number and data are
maintained active for one year. If your Imation Service is not reinstated within such one year period, then your
account and Imation Service will be terminated.  If there is a lapse in Services for any period of time, any
subsequent purchase of Services, which will be permitted at Imation’s sole discretion, will be deemed purchased
retroactive to the date on which any prior Services concluded and you will be charged with an additional twenty
percent (20%) reinstatement fee for the lapsed support period. 

2.4 Survival. Except for the provision of Imation Services hereunder, all applicable provisions of these Terms of Use
shall survive termination, including, without limitation, provisions related to intellectual property, warranty
disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and the miscellaneous provisions.

3. WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

3.1 LIMITED DEVICE WARRANTY. Imation warrants that Imation Products meet all the published hardware
specifications and are free of any material defects in materials or workmanship that would prevent such Imation
Products from performing to the published hardware specifications for one (1) year from the date of purchase (for
individual users) or  activation (for enterprise users) (the "Warranty Period").

If any Imation Product fails to so conform, or proves to have any such defects during such Warranty Period, Imation,
at its option, will provide you a new or refurbished Imation Product at no charge to you. The foregoing warranty (i)
applies only to the Customer or Agent with proof of purchase, (ii) will not apply to Imation Products that have been
damaged as a result of negligent handling, modification, disassembly or misuse, and (iii) will not apply to Imation
Products that have self-destructed due to too many failed password attempts, as this represents proper functionality
of the Imation Product.

Imation Products are not warranted to operate without failure. Imation Products should only be incorporated in
systems designed with appropriate redundancy, fault tolerance or back-up features.

Accordingly, Imation does not recommend the use of Imation Products in life support systems or other applications
where failure could cause injury or loss of life. Therefore if you decide to use Imation Products in connection with
such applications you assume all risk of such use and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Imation
Indemnitees  against any liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
which arise from such use.

PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE OR SERVICES. IMATION EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. YOU
UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH ABOVE, IMATION DOES

REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT OPERATION OF THE IMATION PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY
IMATION, ITS EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, DEALERS OR AGENTS SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN
DURATION TO ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF THE APPLICABLE IMATION PRODUCT
OR SERVICE, AS THE CASE MAY BE. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS.

3.3 LIMITATION ON INTERNATIONAL USE. IMATION DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY THAT ANY CONTENT OR USE OF THE IMATION PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE OR SERVICE IS

OR IN PART FROM ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT OF YOUR EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR THAT OF A
BROWSER PROVIDER, BY AN INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDER, BY AN ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDER OR BY
AN AGENT OR SUBCONTRACTOR OF ANY OF THEM, NOR WILL IMATION OR IMATION'S SERVICE
PROVIDERS OR OTHER AGENTS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR

and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Imation
in asserting any available defenses. You will not settle any action or claims on behalf of Imation without the prior
written consent of Imation. This indemnification is provided without regard to whether Imation's claim for
indemnification is due to the use of the Imation Products, Software or Services by you or your authorized
